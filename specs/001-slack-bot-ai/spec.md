# Feature Specification: Slack Bot Event Organizer AI Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-slack-bot-ai`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "複数人が集まる会（飲み会・ランチ・勉強会など）の幹事をしてくれるSlack Bot型のAIエージェント。日程調整やお店の予約、参加可否の確認、カレンダー追加、会議室予約などを勝手に行ってくれる。使い方はチャンネル内に追加してメンションで呼び出す。チャンネル内の人を対象に幹事をしてくれる。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A team member in a Slack channel wants to organize a group event (drinking party, lunch, study session, etc.). They mention the AI agent bot, which then takes full responsibility for coordinating all aspects of the event including scheduling, venue booking, participant confirmation, calendar integration, and meeting room reservations. The bot communicates with all channel members to gather requirements and handles the entire coordination process autonomously.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user mentions the bot in a Slack channel with an event request, **When** the bot is activated, **Then** it should automatically identify all channel members as potential participants and begin event coordination
2. **Given** the bot has collected participant preferences, **When** scheduling conflicts arise, **Then** it should autonomously find alternative times and confirm with participants
3. **Given** venue requirements are identified, **When** the bot searches for restaurants/venues, **Then** it should make reservations automatically and confirm details with the organizer
4. **Given** event details are finalized, **When** the bot completes planning, **Then** it should add calendar events for all confirmed participants and book necessary meeting rooms

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no suitable time slots are available for all participants?
- How does the system handle venue booking failures or cancellations?
- What occurs when participants change their availability after initial confirmation?
- How does the bot prioritize conflicting requirements (budget vs. location vs. time)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate with Slack channels and respond to mentions
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically identify all channel members as potential event participants
- **FR-003**: System MUST collect participant availability and preferences through Slack interactions
- **FR-004**: System MUST autonomously search for and book suitable venues/restaurants [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: venue booking integration not specified - which platforms/services?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle meeting room reservations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which meeting room system integration required?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with calendar systems to add events for participants [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which calendar systems - Google, Outlook, etc.?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST track participant confirmation status and send reminders
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle different types of events (drinking parties, lunches, study sessions, etc.)
- **FR-009**: System MUST operate autonomously without requiring manual intervention once activated
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide real-time updates on event planning progress to channel members
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle payment coordination [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: payment method and splitting logic not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST store event history and participant preferences [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention period not specified]
- **FR-013**: System MUST authenticate with external services for booking and calendar integration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication methods and permissions not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event**: Represents a planned gathering with type (drinking party, lunch, study session), date/time, location, participant list, and status
- **Participant**: Channel member with availability preferences, dietary restrictions, and participation history
- **Venue**: Restaurant, meeting room, or location with capacity, booking details, and availability
- **Calendar Entry**: Event representation in external calendar systems with attendee information
- **Booking**: Reservation record with venue details, confirmation status, and cancellation policies
