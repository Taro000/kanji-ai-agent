## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An organizer in a Slack channel wants to organize an event (drinking party, lunch, study session, etc.). They mention the AI bot with participant mentions, and the bot autonomously handles the entire event coordination process including participant confirmation via DM, scheduling through DM interactions, venue selection and booking, Google Calendar integration for all participants, meeting room reservations, and final announcement in the channel after organizer approval.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an organizer mentions the bot with @here/@channel or specific user mentions and states event purpose, **When** the bot processes the request, **Then** it should identify required features, confirm with organizer, and begin autonomous coordination
2. **Given** the bot has identified participants and event type, **When** it starts participant confirmation, **Then** it should send DMs to each participant to confirm availability and collect preferences
3. **Given** participants have confirmed availability, **When** scheduling coordination begins, **Then** the bot should propose appropriate time slots based on event type and participant availability through DM interactions
4. **Given** scheduling is complete and venue booking is required, **When** the bot searches for restaurants, **Then** it should autonomously select and book venues appropriate for the event type and group size
5. **Given** all coordination is complete, **When** the bot performs final confirmation, **Then** it should present full details to organizer in thread for approval, add events to all participants' Google Calendars, and announce in channel

### Edge Cases
- What happens when participants don't respond to DM confirmation requests within a reasonable timeframe?
- How does the bot handle venue booking failures or when no suitable venues are available?
- What occurs when the organizer requests changes during intermediate confirmations?
- How does the bot prioritize when event type requirements conflict with participant preferences?
- What happens when Google Calendar integration fails for some participants?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST respond to bot mentions in Slack channels with participant specifications (@here, @channel, or specific user mentions)
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and confirm event purpose/type with organizer before beginning coordination
- **FR-003**: System MUST determine required features based on event type and confirm with organizer (with ability to modify based on feedback)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow organizer to configure intermediate confirmation requirements (Yes/No) for scheduling and venue selection
- **FR-005**: System MUST send direct messages to all identified participants to confirm availability and collect preferences
- **FR-006**: System MUST conduct scheduling coordination via DM interactions with participants
- **FR-007**: System MUST propose time slot candidates appropriate for event type and context
