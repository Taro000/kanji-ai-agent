# Research: Enhanced Slack Bot Event Organizer AI Agent

## Technical Decisions

### Agent Development Kit (ADK) Integration
**Decision**: Use Agent Development Kit (ADK) as primary framework for AI agent coordination
**Rationale**:
- Provides multi-agent orchestration capabilities
- Built-in tool integration for external API calls
- Supports Python development with type hints
- Handles async coordination between agents
**Alternatives considered**:
- LangChain: More complex, less focused on agent coordination
- Custom agent framework: Reinventing the wheel, longer development time

### Multi-Agent Architecture
**Decision**: Implement specialized sub-agents for different tasks
**Rationale**:
- Participant Agent: Handles DM interactions and confirmation tracking
- Scheduling Agent: Manages calendar coordination and time slot optimization
- Venue Agent: Handles restaurant/venue search and booking coordination
- Calendar Agent: Manages Google Calendar integration and meeting room reservations
- Coordination Agent: Orchestrates overall workflow and maintains state
**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic bot: Less maintainable, harder to test individual components
- External microservices: More complex deployment, network latency issues

### Slack Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Use Slack Bolt SDK for Python with Event API and OAuth 2.0
**Rationale**:
- Official Slack SDK with comprehensive support
- Built-in OAuth flow handling
- Event-driven architecture fits multi-agent coordination
- Supports threaded conversations for intermediate confirmations
**Alternatives considered**:
- Slack Web API direct calls: More boilerplate, missing helper functions
- slack-sdk: Older SDK with less robust event handling

### Google Calendar API Integration
**Decision**: Use Google Calendar API v3 with OAuth 2.0 service account delegation
**Rationale**:
- Allows bot to act on behalf of users with proper permissions
- Supports both personal calendar and resource (meeting room) management
- Well-documented Python client library
- Handles rate limiting and retries
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct CalDAV: More complex, limited Google Workspace integration
- Zapier/third-party: Adds dependency, limited customization

### Venue Search APIs
**Decision**: Primary: Google Places API, Secondary: ぐるなびAPI
**Rationale**:
- Google Places: Comprehensive venue data, reviews, photos, global coverage
- ぐるなび: Better Japanese restaurant data, booking information
- Fallback strategy when one API fails or has insufficient results
**Alternatives considered**:
- OpenTable API: Limited to participating restaurants
- Foursquare/Swarm: Less current business information
- Web scraping: Unreliable, legal concerns

### State Management
**Decision**: GCP Firestore for event coordination state
**Rationale**:
- NoSQL flexibility for varying event types and participant data
- Real-time updates for multi-agent coordination
- Automatic scaling and managed infrastructure
- Native GCP integration for Cloud Run deployment
**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL: Relational overhead for flexible event data
- Redis: In-memory limitations for persistent event history
- Local JSON files: Not suitable for multi-instance deployment

### Deployment Architecture
**Decision**: GCP Cloud Run with containerized deployment
**Rationale**:
- Serverless scaling for variable event coordination load
- Native GCP integration with Firestore and other services
- Container portability and consistent environments
- Cost-effective pay-per-use model
**Alternatives considered**:
- GCP App Engine: Less container control, Python runtime limitations
- AWS Lambda: Cold start issues for complex agent coordination
- Traditional VMs: Over-provisioning costs, manual scaling

### Error Handling and Resilience
**Decision**: Circuit breaker pattern for external APIs with manual fallback workflows
**Rationale**:
- Graceful degradation when external services fail
- User notification and manual override options
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retry logic
- Comprehensive logging for debugging multi-agent workflows
**Alternatives considered**:
- Fail-fast approach: Poor user experience during outages
- Infinite retries: Resource exhaustion and blocking other events

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Three-tier testing approach
**Rationale**:
1. Unit tests: Individual agent logic and business rules
2. Contract tests: External API integration points with mocked responses
3. Integration tests: End-to-end event coordination workflows
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Not scalable for complex multi-agent interactions
- Only integration tests: Slow feedback, difficult debugging

## Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven Agent Coordination
- Use ADK's event bus for inter-agent communication
- Each agent subscribes to relevant event types
- Maintains loose coupling between specialized agents
- Enables parallel processing where possible

### External API Tool Integration
- Wrap each external API (Slack, Google Calendar, venue search) as ADK tools
- Implement retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
- Abstract API differences behind consistent tool interfaces
- Enable agent swapping for different venue search providers

### Conversation State Management
- Track conversation context in Firestore
- Enable pause/resume of event coordination workflows
- Support multiple concurrent events per user/channel
- Maintain audit trail for debugging and user transparency
